# Parallel Extensions Extras

This is a mirror of the Parallel Extensions Extras project Microsoft provides
as part of their 
[Samples for Parallel Programming with the .NET Framework](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ParExtSamples).

The primary purpose of this repository is to maintain a MonoTouch project for
MonoTouch build compatibility.
